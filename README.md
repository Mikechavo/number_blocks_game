# Number Blocks Game
## Introduction
This is a simple web-based game designed to help my daughter, Satori, learn basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction).

## Features
Allows Satori to press buttons associated with numbers (0-9) and mathematical operators (+, -).
Displays the equation as it is being constructed.
Calculates the result when the '=' button is pressed.
Provides feedback on the result:
Shows the equation and result.
Displays a visual aid of blocks representing the result, unless the result is negative or exceeds 100.
Special message "Let's practice easier math right now!" for negative results.
Notification for results over 100 ("That's a really big number!").

## Technologies Used
Vue.js for the frontend logic and interface.
HTML and CSS for layout and styling.

## Usage
Press numbers and operators to build an equation.
Press '=' to calculate the result.
See the equation and result displayed.
Observe visual aids or messages based on the result.

## About
This game was created with love by me for my daughter, Satori, to make learning math fun and engaging. Itâ€™s a part of our journey to explore learning through play. This game is still in the early stages.
